<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a medical doctor, R educator and tech enthusiast who transitioned from academic research into health data science.  I am an Indian Council of Medical Reseach-funded co-Principal Investigator. I am also a contributing member of the [R Epidemics Consortium (RECon)](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/people/).


I am currently pursuing a PhD in Health Data Science from [Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum](https://www.sctimst.ac.in/) where my research work is focused on applying epidemiology, spatio-temoral methods and data science to generate actionable evidence using data from the routine health information systems. 

I hail from [Rampachodavaram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampachodavaram), a small tribal village in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, India. I enjoy roaming about and connecting with people.
