  ## Lately

  I am currently pursuing a PhD in Health Data Science from [Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Trivandrum](https://www.sctimst.ac.in/) where my research work is focused on applying epidemiology, spatio-temoral methods and data science to generate actionable evidence using data from the routine health information systems. 

  I hail from [Rampachodavaram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampachodavaram), a small tribal village in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, India.

  I love my family. My wife and my beautiful daughter are my driving force and source of inspiration.
