The below interactive plot is variant of the epidemic curve of COVID-19 in India. By default, the weekly average of daily cases, recovered and deaths is presented in the plot.</description>

With over 4,00,000 cases being reported daily, India has over 37,00,000 active cases as of 12, May 2021. This post aims to estimate the epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 epidemic in India during the first and second waves.
As discussed in the previous post, Indiaâ€™s epidemic curve suggests an ongoing second wave of COVID-19 infections in the country.</description>
